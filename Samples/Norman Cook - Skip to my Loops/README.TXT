*************************************************************************
***********

Congratulations on your purchase. Here is important information regarding 
this CD-ROM, please take a second to read it through. 

USER INFO
AUDIO TRACKS - Full versions of many sounds are presented normalised to 
uniform levels for easy sampling. WAVs for each can be found in their 
respective folders. There are many additional WAVs not featured on the 
audio portion due to space limitations. Assuming you are using this 
CD-ROM with a computer you can simply treat the audio section as a demo. 
Track 1 will usually not play on regular CD players as it contains the 
CD-ROM data - DO NOT PLAY IT AS IT MAY DAMAGE YOUR AUDIO EQUIPMENT - so 
audio tracks are start from Track 2. Just to confuse things computers 
will usually adjust the tracks by ignoring the data making Track 1 play 
as Track 1 as listed.

WAV FILES - All are trimmed to loop at their appropriate BPM. Names have 
been reduced to three digits and a code for quick identification. Loops 
may have been tempo-grouped for easy use, however you may wish to create 
and compile your own tempo-grouped folders. 

TEMPO GROUPED FOLDERS - As these loops are all at the same tempo it gives 
you the opportunity to be creative very quickly. Because of slight 
variations in timing as a natural result of the performances featured you 
will find that there may be slight timing variations if you layer 
different loops for a number of bars in succession. This may not be an 
issue depending on how the software you are using handles WAVs.

STUDIO MASTER SOFTWARE - Studio Master is a 20-channel real time mixing 
program with independent panning and volume controls for each channel. 
StudioMaster supports various sound formats including Windows WAV files, 
Sun AU files, Real Audio(TM) or Mac AIFF files. Finished musical 
compositions can be outputted to disk in CD quality.

 
When you first load the program load the 'B2.B2' file in the SONGS folder.

For more information on Studio Master visit www.dancesoft.com. For all 
technical queries regarding Studio Master please contact Dance Soft via 
their website or fax UK+(0)1705 820628. 

Some samples given the same number may be slightly different in each 
format. They should essentially be the same sound although they may be a 
slightly different and have different loop points. These occasional 
variations are simply caused by the optimisation of each format.

Studio Master Readme Version 1.04 English


Welcome to Studio Master lite, the easy way to produce studio quality music on your PC. In order to use the software with the sounds included on this CD correctly, you must use sound files from the same tempo/bmp group. You can not use say 120bpm with 140bpm files, so pick files that have the same tempo/bpm. Studio Master should calculate the tempo/bpm for your song when you load in the first sound file, if your mix does not sound in time then set the tempo yourself in the files/properties box.

Happy mixing and don't forget to check out www.dancesoft.com for more sounds and software.

System Requirements


·	Windows 95 or later

·	16 MB of RAM or more

·	Pentium 60 or higher

·	DirectSound compatible sound card

·	Display capable of 640x480x256 or higher.

·	10 MB for Studio Master installation. 6 MB for DirectX 5.0 installation. 20 MB or more free space for temporary storage while Studio Master is running. 

Installation

Insert the Studio Master CD into your CD-ROM drive, click the START button on the Windows(r) 95 taskbar and then click RUN. Type in "d:\setup.exe" (where 'd' is the designation of your CD-ROM drive).

Troubleshooting


Studio Master reports "Unable to capture wave device."


·	Another application is using your sound card.  Close the application currently controlling your sound card. 

Studio Master runs slowly

·	Please check whether your system meet the minimum requirements.

*	Since Windows(r) 95 is a multitasking environment, any applications that are running may use some of your system resources. So, close all unnecessary applications may speed up the game.

·	Studio Master uses a component called DirectX from Microsoft. DirectX requires DirectX supported video card and sound card drivers to run optimally. Although the DirectX component has a lot of popular drivers. It doesn't have everything. Please check whether your system has DirectX supported drivers.

Studio Master music play back choppy


·	Studio Master music data must always reside in system memory in order to perform optimally. There are several reasons that the music data cannot be reside in system memory.

·	Other applications are running and they are actively doing some processing.

Solution: Close all unused applications and stop all the background processing. (e.g. recalculation of a spreadsheet, finding a file from explorer, etc.)

·	Play back format is set too high that the music data is using a lot of memory. If the play back format is set at the highest quality (44kHz 16bit stereo), the music data may occupied up to 20 MB or more. Computers that have 16 MB (or sometimes 32 MB) cannot play the song properly.

Solution: Set the playback format a little bit lower. Normally, playback format should be set at 22kHz 16 bit stereo and check the Mono Source Only check box. Most computers can play Studio Master song properly in this setting.


DirectX installation replaced original video drivers

·	DirectX installation always tries to update your video and audio drivers with the latest version. However, updating the video driver may disable your video card specific utilities. If you want to keep the utilities, please either obtain the latest video driver from the manufacturer, or go to the CD "\Studio Master\directX" directory and run "dsetup.exe" and then click on the restore video driver button.
